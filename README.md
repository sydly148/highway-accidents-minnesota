# Highway Accident Rates in Minnesota in 1973

by Sydney Ly

This dataset describes the accidents per million vehicle miles from 39 sections of large highways in Minnesota in 1973. The data also includes other factors, such as lane width, speed limit, average daily traffic count, number of lanes, and the width of the outer shoulder as possible links to accident rate. It was downloaded from the [Rdatasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html) website. 

TODO: Put visualization here

In the above visualization, it appears that the accident rate is actually higher when the average daily traffic count is lower, with speed limits of around 50 mph and under actually having higher accident rates than speed limits above 50 mph.
